A few minutes ago we saw how we could perform a sweep using the submit command.
But there was one part of the process I left out.

After you type the submit command and press the Enter key, submit goes through
the command line flags and determines how and where to run the job. If you asked
to sweep a parameter, submit uses a program named Pegasus to create and manage
the multiple jobs as a type of wideband workflow.

(show slide of pegasus details, who made it, bindings, features.)

Pegasus takes care of transferring files and executables between the HUB and
the grid and tracking their progress, capturing provenance and performance
information about each step of the workflow.

(show picture of the path from workspace to grid, blowup image of the workflow
in a thought bubble to the left, with little files to denote the provenance and
performance info being stored by pegasus)

For many of the tools on hubs, these steps are transparent to the user, but
developers can take advantage of Pegasus in two ways. Developers can allow Submit
to build a workflow for them, as shown earlier, or write their own workflow.
Let's investigate how to build your own workflow and get Pegasus to run it on
the grid.
